          This business was initially created exclusively for US Veterans. But
          now it is available for civilians who support Veteran Employment.
          There are tremendous advantages for hiring Veterans, and if you want
          to participate in doing so, then WELCOME. We will do for you what we
          have done for many dozens of entrepreneurial Veterans across America.
        </p>

        <h2>Advantages of Hiring U.S. Veterans</h2>
        <p class="box">
          There are several tremendous advantages to hiring U.S. Veterans for a
          cleaning business. They are some of the very few US citizens who have
          all been trained and drilled in keeping everything “Inspection Ready.”
          Also, it gives you a tremendous competitive advantage in acquiring
          accounts. It elevates your bid above others by offering business
          owners an opportunity to thank them for their sacrifices and service
          by helping them support themselves and their families.
        </p>

        <p class="box">
          The Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program is specifically
          designed to help veterans with service-connected disabilities get and
          keep a job. The VR&E program provides a number of benefits to
          employers who hire eligible veterans, including reimbursements that
          reduce the cost of training new employees. The VA can also help
          employers access federal tax credits for hiring veterans.
        </p>

        <h2>On-the-Job Training (OJT) Program</h2>

        <p class="box">
          Under this program, the VA can pay a portion of the veteran's salary
          for up to 24 months while they receive training. As the veteran's
          skills and productivity increase, the employer's share of the salary
          gradually increases until the training is complete, and the veteran is
          fully integrated into the workforce.
        </p>
        <p class="box">
          By participating in the VR&E program, you not only help disabled U.S.
          Veterans but also receive valuable support and financial assistance to
          ensure their success.
        </p>
        <p class="box">
          Fully staffing your company with U.S. Veterans may not be possible.
          Although helping our U.S. Veterans to support themselves and their
          families is a wonderful thing to do, ultimately you want to hire the
          best employees you can to do quality work and to represent your
          business.
